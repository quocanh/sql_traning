For all queries all returned rows must satisfy query conditions.

In addition to that:
- INNER JOIN: Returns all rows that exist in BOTH tables
- LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, if required field is not found from the right table its value is NULL.
- LEFT JOIN is shortcut for LEFT OUTER JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, if required field is not found from the left table its value is NULL.
- RIGHT JOIN is shortcut for RIGHT OUTER JOIN
- FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all rows from the left table (table1) and from the right table (table2).
- OUTER JOIN is shortcut for FULL OUTER JOIN

Note: mysql doesn't support OUTER JOIN.
